              Estimating smallholder crop yields robustly and timely is crucial for improving agronomic practices, determining yield gaps, guiding investment, and policymaking to ensure food security. However, there is poor estimation of yield for most smallholders due to lack of technology, and field scale data, particularly in Egypt. Automated machine learning (AutoML) can be used to automate the machine learning workflow, including automatic training and optimization of multiple models within a user-specified time frame, but it has less attention so far. Here, we combined extensive field survey yield across wheat cultivated area in Egypt with diverse dataset of remote sensing, soil, and weather to predict field-level wheat yield using 22 Ml models in AutoML. The models showed robust accuracies for yield predictions, recording Willmott degree of agreement, (d {\textgreater} 0.80) with higher accuracy when super learner (stacked ensemble) was used (R 
              2 
              = 0.51, d = 0.82). The trained AutoML was deployed to predict yield using remote sensing (RS) vegetative indices (VIs), demonstrating a good correlation with actual yield (R 
              2 
              = 0.7). This is very important since it is considered a low-cost tool and could be used to explore early yield predictions. Since climate change has negative impacts on agricultural production and food security with some uncertainties, AutoML was deployed to predict wheat yield under recent climate scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). These scenarios included single downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) as CanESM5 and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) as SSP2-4.5and SSP5-8.5during the mid-term period (2050). The stacked ensemble model displayed declines in yield of 21\% and 5\% under SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 respectively during mid-century, with higher uncertainty under the highest emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). The developed approach could be used as a rapid, accurate and low-cost method to predict yield for stakeholder farms all over the world where ground data is scarce.},

	abstract = {Yield prediction is of great significance in agricultural production. Remote sensing technology based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers the capacity of non-intrusive crop yield prediction with low cost and high throughput. In this study, a winter wheat field experiment with three levels of irrigation (T1 = 240 mm, T2 = 190 mm, T3 = 145 mm) was conducted in Henan province. Multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy water stress indices (CWSI) were obtained using an UAV equipped with multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A framework combining a long short-term memory neural network and random forest (LSTM-RF) was proposed for predicting wheat yield using VIs and CWSI from multi-growth stages as predictors. Validation results showed that the R2 of 0.61 and the RMSE value of 878.98 kg/ha was achieved in predicting grain yield using LSTM. LSTM-RF model obtained better prediction results compared to the LSTM with n R2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 684.1 kg/ha, which is equivalent to a 22\% reduction in RMSE. The results showed that LSTM-RF considered both the time-series characteristics of the winter wheat growth process and the non-linear characteristics between remote sensing data and crop yield data, providing an alternative for accurate yield prediction in modern agricultural management.},

	abstract = {The article provides an overview of the accuracy of various yield forecasting algorithms and offers a detailed explanation of the models and machine learning algorithms that are required for crop yield forecasting. A unified crop yield forecasting methodology is developed, which can be adjusted by adding new indicators and extensions. The proposed methodology is based on remote sensing data taken from free sources. Experiments were carried out on crops of cereals, legumes, oilseeds and forage crops in eastern Kazakhstan. Data on agricultural lands of the experimental farms were obtained using processed images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites (EO Browser) for the period of 2017–2022. In total, a dataset of 1600 indicators was collected with NDVI and MSAVI indices recorded at a frequency of once a week. Based on the results of this work, it is found that yields can be predicted from NDVI vegetation index data and meteorological data on average temperature, surface soil moisture and wind speed. A machine learning programming language can calculate the relationship between these indicators and build a neural network that predicts yield. The neural network produces predictions based on the constructed data weights, which are corrected using activation function algorithms. As a result of the research, the functions with the highest prediction accuracy during vegetative development for all crops presented in this paper are multi-layer perceptron, with a prediction accuracy of 66\% to 99\% (85\% on average), and polynomial regression, with a prediction accuracy of 63\% to 98\% (82\% on average). Thus, it is shown that the use of machine learning and neural networks for crop yield prediction has advantages over other mathematical modelling techniques. The use of machine learning (neural network) technologies makes it possible to predict crop yields on the basis of relevant data. The individual approach of machine learning to each crop allows for the determination of the optimal learning algorithms to obtain accurate predictions.},

            Hydroclimate time series often exhibit very low year‐to‐year autocorrelation while showing prolonged wet and dry epochs reminiscent of regime‐shifting behavior. Traditional stochastic time series models cannot capture the regime‐shifting features thereby misrepresenting the risk of prolonged wet and dry periods, consequently impacting management and planning efforts. Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) annual flow series highlights this clearly. To address this, a simulation framework is developed using a hidden Markov (HM) model in combination with large‐scale climate indices that drive multidecadal variability. We demonstrate this on the UCRB flows and show that the simulations are able to capture the regime features by reproducing the multidecadal spectral features present in the data where a basic HM model without climate information cannot.

Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example.

            Testing our understanding of crop yield responses to weather fluctuations at global scale is notoriously hampered by limited information about underlying management conditions, such as cultivar selection or fertilizer application. Here, we demonstrate that accounting for observed spatial variations in growing seasons increases the variance in reported national maize and wheat yield anomalies that can be explained by process-based model simulations from 34 to 58\% and 47 to 54\% across the 10 most weather-sensitive main producers, respectively. For maize, the increase in explanatory power is similar to the increase achieved by accounting for water stress, as compared to simulations assuming perfect water supply in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Representing water availability constraints in irrigation is of second-order importance. We improve the model’s explanatory power by better representing crops’ exposure to observed weather conditions, without modifying the weather response itself. This growing season adjustment now allows for a close reproduction of heat wave and drought impacts on crop yields.},

            Forecasting crop yields is becoming increasingly important under the current context in which food security needs to be ensured despite the challenges brought by climate change, an expanding world population accompanied by rising incomes, increasing soil erosion, and decreasing water resources. Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture.},

A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient.
